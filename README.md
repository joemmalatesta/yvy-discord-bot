discord bot for pulling recent plays from osu!

Uhhhhh this is my very first project. I just made a new github because my last one was all over the place with unfinished projects. I had a few prior commits that better
showed what was happening as time progressed but I have a written timeline of my thoghts in the working code files. 

The unfinished, poorly written code that is not in use and has been refactored is in the dead code section of the files. 

Theres not much to this bot. It just stores a users osu! profile in a mongoDB database, stored using the discord ID. From there, there are just a few simple discord bot 
commands that pull data from the osu! api and return it in a discord embed. 


For future projects, I want to experiment with different API's, libraries, and databases to see where my bias lies :)
